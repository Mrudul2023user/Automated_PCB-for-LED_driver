Python‑driven KiCad workflow that auto‑generates schematic, PCB, Gerbers, and documentation for an LED‑driver board.

1. Make sure to install any version of python 3 or more

2. Download the given scripts "generate_led_pcb_with_tracks.py", "led_driver_json" and make sure to place them in a same folder.

3. Go to the command prompt and source the folder where the project files are located and begint to run the program by using the commands as "python generate_led_pcb_with_tracks.py" .
